  <section id="who-we-are">
    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>Boost Me! is developed and published by Manuel Radons ("we", "us", "our"). For any privacy-related questions, please contact <a href="mailto:boostmeappcontact+privacy@gmail.com?subject=%5BBoost%20Me%5D%20Privacy%20Request">boostmeappcontact+privacy@gmail.com</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="scope">
    <h2>2. Scope of this policy</h2>
    <p>This Policy applies to the Boost Me! Android application distributed via Google Play and our official channels.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="regional-availability">
    <h2>3. Regional availability & compliance</h2>
    <p><strong>The App is currently not distributed in the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland.</strong> Accordingly, the App does <strong>not</strong> present an in-app consent dialog (CMP). If we expand distribution to those regions, we will implement a Google-certified Consent Management Platform (UMP, IAB TCF 2.2) and update this Policy.</p>
    <p>Outside the EEA/UK/CH, the App does not present a consent dialog; analytics and ads operate under the controls described in this Policy and your Android settings.</p>

  <section id="third-parties">
    <h2>5. Third-party services & advertising</h2>
    <p>The App integrates the following third-party SDKs, which are governed by their own privacy terms:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Service</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Links</th></tr>
      </thead>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>Analytics configuration:</strong> We have disabled Google Signals and granular device/location collection. Data retention is set to <strong>2 months</strong> for event data and <strong>14 months</strong> for user-level data (no “reset on new activity”).</p>

    <p>Google may collect device information (e.g., Advertising ID, IP address) to deliver and measure ads.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Ad personalisation control:</strong> Whether ads are <strong>personalised</strong> or <strong>non-personalised</strong> is determined by your Android system setting:</p>
      <p><strong>Android Settings → Google → Ads → <em>Opt out of Ads Personalisation</em> / <em>Delete advertising ID</em></strong>.</p>
      <p>The App <strong>does not</strong> present its own consent dialog and <strong>does not</strong> offer an in-app toggle for ad personalisation. If your device is opted-out (or the ID is unavailable/deleted), the App requests <strong>non-personalised</strong> ads; otherwise, Google may show <strong>personalised</strong> ads based on your device-level choice.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <section id="use-of-data">
    <h2>7. How we use data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core features such as displaying boosts, saving favourites, and scheduling exact alarms.</li>
      <li>Display <strong>non-personalised or personalised ads</strong> — controlled by your Android ad-personalisation setting (see § 5). There is <strong>no in-app consent flow</strong>.</li>
      <li>Diagnose crashes and improve performance (aggregated store statistics only).</li>
      <li>Measure anonymous usage with Firebase / Google Analytics for Firebase to understand which features are used and to improve reliability (no Google Signals; limited device/location data).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not sell or rent</strong> any data. We do <strong>not</strong> transfer locally stored in-app data off your device.</p>

  <section id="legal-basis">
    <h2>8. Legal basis (GDPR)</h2>
    <p><em>Note:</em> The App is not currently distributed in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland. If you nevertheless access the App from such a region, the following bases describe how processing would be justified:</p>
    <table>

          <td>Ad delivery/measurement & fraud prevention</td>

          <td>Firebase / Google Analytics for Firebase (anonymous usage measurement)</td>

        </tr>

    </table>
  </section>

  <section id="retention">
    <h2>9. Data retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local app data</strong> — remains on your device until you uninstall the App or clear the App’s data in system settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad/measurement data</strong> — is retained by Google in accordance with its policies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Firebase / Google Analytics for Firebase:</strong> event data retention is configured to <strong>2 months</strong> and user-level retention to <strong>14 months</strong>. “Reset on new user activity” is turned off.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="security">
    <h2>10. Security</h2>
    <p>All sensitive operations (favourites, schedules) run entirely on-device. No remote server operated by us stores your in-app data. While we take care to use the platform securely, no mobile system can guarantee absolute security.</p>
  </section>

 <section id="rights">
  <h2>11. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to processing, obtain data portability, and lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Because we do not maintain user accounts, we may ask for your device’s Advertising ID or other proof of use to locate relevant records.</p>
  <p><strong>Analytics &amp; ads controls:</strong> We currently do not offer an individual in-app deletion mechanism. You can stop further analytics and ads collection by uninstalling the App. For ads, you can reset or remove your Advertising ID in Android settings (<em>Settings → Google → Ads → Delete advertising ID</em>) and/or opt out of ads personalisation. Analytics event data in Google Analytics is configured to expire after 2 months; advertising/measurement data is retained by Google under its own policies.</p>
</section>

  <section id="international">
    <h2>12. International processing</h2>
    <p>Third-party providers (e.g., Google) may process data on servers outside your country. Where required, such transfers rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).</p>
  </section>

  <section id="changes">
    <h2>13. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated in-app or on the store listing. Continued use of the App after changes implies acceptance.</p>
